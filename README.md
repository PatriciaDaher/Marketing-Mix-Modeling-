# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) for Multi-Channel Optimization
### By Patricia Daher

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) to optimize multi-channel media spend to help businesses measure the effectiveness of their marketing activities across various channels (TV, Digital, Print, Radio, etc.) and provides data-driven recommendations for budget allocation.

## Key Features
Statistical Modeling: Quantifies the impact of each marketing channel
Adstock Transformation: Models carryover effects of advertising
Saturation Effects: Accounts for diminishing returns at high spend levels
Budget Optimization: Recommends optimal spend allocation across channels
Multiple Approaches: Includes both classical regression and Bayesian methods
Visualization Tools: Response curves, coefficient importance, and time series analysis

## Installation
Clone this repository: https://github.com/PatriciaDaher/Marketing-Mix-Modeling-.git

## bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-mix-modeling.git
cd marketing-mix-modeling
Install the required libraries

## bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, pymc3, arviz

## Usage
#### Running the Model
With Synthetic Data (Demo Mode):
#### python
python mmm_model.py
With Your Own Data:
Prepare a CSV file with your marketing data
Modify the data loading section in mmm_model.py
#### Run the script
Key Parameters to Adjust
channels: List your marketing channels
adstock_params: Adjust theta (decay rate) and L (max lag)
hill_params: Adjust alpha (shape) and gamma (half-saturation point)
total_budget: Set your marketing budget constraint

## Data Requirements
Your input data should include (as columns):
Time Index: Date or period indicator
Media Spend: By channel (e.g., "TV_Spend", "Digital_Spend")
Business Outcomes: Sales, conversions, or other KPIs
Control Variables: Price, promotions, holidays, etc.
Example format:
Date	TV_Spend	Digital_Spend	Print_Spend	Sales	Price	Promo
2020-01-01	45.2	32.1	12.5	215	9.99	0
## Model Outputs
Channel Effectiveness:
ROI estimates for each channel
Contribution percentages
Optimization Results:
Recommended spend by channel
Expected lift from reallocation
Visualizations:
Response curves
Coefficient plots
Time series decompositions

## Customization Guide
To adapt the model to your specific needs:
For Different Industries:
Adjust adstock parameters (longer for durable goods, shorter for FMCG)
Modify saturation points based on your market
For Additional Channels:
Add new channels to the channels list
Ensure proper column names in your data
For Different Frequencies:
Change time aggregation (weekly/monthly)
Adjust seasonal decomposition parameters

## Limitations
Requires sufficient historical data (minimum 1-2 years recommended)
Works best with consistent marketing tracking
Less granular than user-level attribution models
